Have been posting items of good value, and have sold an item also on Offer Up. But today, my account was removed. Seems they judge a book by it's cover instead of doing a little homework, to see if what you are selling is a real item or not. I posted about 8 things the last couple of days, one being a Christmas Tree In A Bag, that several places sell, like **** and ***** ****. Described what it was and even used a clear picture, but I guess instead of doing a little research, they decided it was not a Christmas Tree, but paraphernalia, and without any communication with me, just removed my account as items I had posted were collecting alerts! Guess that's what happens when kids run a site like this! So if you are reading this, my items are in ************ *** ***** ** ****. Find me on ** where you will see what you wanted to buy before I was removed.

Realized it was a scam and told him to f*** off. Reported it to Offer Up. Tried twice to review in Play Store without the "f" word. Both times my review was deleted.

This site really is a waste of time. Okay, it's not OfferUp's fault, because they can't control who joins the site, but all but one of the OfferUp users I've dealt with were total A-Holes.

I've been selling on-line for 20+ years. I do my homework, and always price my items below fair market value, yet on OfferUp I constantly get low-ball offers well below half my asking price, even on listings where the price is firm. Then, after negotiating a price we both agree on, I either never hear from the Buyer again, or the Buyer schedules a pick up time and never shows up.

Again, this sort of stuff is beyond OfferUp's control, but I have no tolerance for inconsiderate people and this site is teeming with them, so unless you enjoy having people insult your intelligence and waste your time, just stay away.

Offerup SUCKS!! Don't waste your time because you'll lose all your work.
No method to re-post so lots of copy and paste, re-uploading photos, waste of bandwidth. No way to edit your posting on your desktop so very inefficient for serious seller who lists hundreds of items.
They deactivated my account because I changed my username from my real name to something more appealing, no warning.

The website intro and rules read well and is actually inspiring, but the follow through is nonexistent.

I went on looking for an item, then read all that and registered to sell some, but can't even download the app. Keep getting a loop that says wait 5 minutes. It's been 2 days, and I can't even get a response from the support department.

The reviews are mixed. Maybe this is why?

There are a variety of items that seem reasonable, and it' s a local market, which can be good, but lots of car and bike parts, which is a red flag, but they're all over Craigslist as well.

I'm already walking away because if I can't get a reply to a basic error message to finish setting up my account, what's the rest going to be like? If I download the app, are they going to want access to all of my private contacts etc like everyone else?

No thanks!

At least Craigslist works and is easy to use.

At least Craigslist is easy to set up...

I bought Sephora's Cosmetic from Jennifer in the city of Manteca, when I sent a message to Jennifer to tell her that if she had more products she told me that in Offer Up all the sale is final and that she was taking a bath. I told her I would wait for her until she finished bathing and then she was more rude and threatened me and told me that if I did not leave her home she would call the police, she reported me and I reported her but William an Offer Up worker took me out of Offer Up and I can not buy or sell anymore but Jennifer can still sell on Offer Up because she did not get it out of the page, I have evidence of how rude Jennifer was with me and William just tells me that everything is under investigation, I'm very angry because they are not the same with everyone.

My first few local purchases were great - no complaints or problems! The last purchase I made wasnt worth anything. Upon arriving at the sellers house, my picks were already boxed up & I got the bums rush. I was literally rushed out, a guy put the box in my car - without my being able to look at anything! Was given impression he was watching football & wanted to get back to his game. Once Home, I discovered the books were from 35 to 50 years old - the picture & frame had no glass! My own fault for not saying wait a minute so I can check things. Valuable lesson learned - check things out before you hand someone your money!

I will give ZERO star if I could. I bought a paint sprayer from Miguel Cabrarrera at Modesto, CA (now changed name to: Keith Johnson). He said it works great but when I tested at home, it doesn't even work. I called him and he agreed to give me refund. I took me over an hour to meet him up but he never showed up nor answered the phone. I spoke to his neighbor, they said his is a thief, steeling staff and sell them. Offerup can't even write review to a seller, BE VERY CAREFUL.

The only thing is some sellers they tend to forget they are selling used item once an item is not in it's original box it's used. They want to hold on to the item I understand they might have paid good money for some stuff but once you used it it's no longer new and it's not worth close to the price you bought it from the store. So I see some people complaining about not selling well y'all need to let go of the stuff .for those who are moving and selling their stuff either you'd have to trash it or give it away. You have the opportunity to sell it don't think you're gonna get close to the money you bought the item as new.

HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE. Kills me to give them ANY star! There is no customer service...they dont know jack about how to run a business. There upgrades are downgrades. This is how inept and STUPID the founders/owners whatever they are. Are.
When you try to delete an item OR edit it....the item pops up with a few options...and freezes! You can click on an option...not go back...or ANYTHING!!! You must delete the app....then go back and download it...EACH TIME !!!! Try to contact them . They have to be ranked the worst site... HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE.

I tried to register as a different user - same problems. I tried to delete app and re-load - no improvement. It seems that my problems with Offer-Up are my cellphone number related. So far no solution is found.

I used app for a year. I liked it from the start. It is easy to use and effective. Great alternative to CL.
Till few months ago all old notifications disappeared, no new notifications, no messages, and no posted ads. Yes, I cannot find any of my ads, ... old, new, none. App becomes useless!
I sent many requests for technical help. No reaction, no help. The customer support not exists. No phone number, no replies, nada.

IT SUCKS THAT I HAD TO EVEN GIVE THIS APP 1 STAR BECAUSE I WOULD'VE GIVEN NEGATIVE IF GIVEN THE CHANCE!!!! NOT ONLY WAS MY FATHER IN LAW SCAMMED OUT OF 800.00 BUT I HAVE REPORTED THE ITEM AND PERSON SELLING AND SCAMMING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR MONEY AND THIS SITE HAS STILL DONE NOTHING TO FIX THE PROBLEM, THEY WON'T TAKE THE OFFERS DOWN WHICH LEADS MORE PEOPLE TO GETTING SCAMMED!!!! I AM SO FRUSTRATED AT THE LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE FROM THIS COMPANY ITS RIDICULOUS. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PEOPLE USING YOUR APP, DELETE IT!!

My messages don't go through for weeks at a time. The first time this happened it was months. I thought everyone selling was just coincidentally flakey but then suddenly weeks of responses would start flooding my inbox, items already sold, of course. I don't need the head ache. Letgo and FB Marketplace work just fine!

If I could pu a -1 I would I bought a exercise bike from some one in 77082 zip it was broke so buyers beware all this $#*! people sake is not worth the effort go buy your $#*!

The app itself is fine, but unfortunately it seems most people just use it to kill time. They make ridiculous offers and sometimes even have a conversation with you about meeting times and places and then just disappear off the face of the Earth. Unfortunately this has been nothing but a waste of time for me.

This site is a waste of time. Most Sellers don't answer and just ignore your offers and questions. Not only that, but people price their stuff too high, and clearly from the endless pictures of item on dirty floor, nasty bedspread, or filthy stained carpet does not justify high price. Don't waste your time. Go on Ebay. It's still the best place to buy used and new stuff at great price if you are patient.

This app is easy to use but not much luck with it...people ask you questions in the middle of night and never get back to you...no serious buyers for me yet ..let go app is much better!

The app is easy and fun to use. Have yet to sell anything, though. As for buyer responses, you get very low ball offers, or people just messing with you. Had better luck with Craigslist. Also, I wish they would have a different chime for sales vs notifications. I guess it's to make sure you look at your phone reminding you of the app, because you're not sure if the chime your heard is indicating a sale or a notification.

I've been on this site for several months now, made offers, sent messages, and nobody ever responds. My views of this service are dwindling down quickly.

I read the reviews, and most were so poor. People not following through, bad offers, etc. Get over yourselves. It's a great place to post stuff you want to see. Keep an open mind and laid back attitude. If you are not willing to negotiate a price, go to eBay. This site has value.

Don't buy anything from these guys it's a total scam you will be ripped off of your money and there's nothing true of value to distinguish the amount of quality and integrity of life these days these people will rip you off and they're using sites like this to rip you off so don't buy anything from this site

Two scammers (or maybe it's the same person) reached out to me just days after I posted an item. Both of them sounded eager to make the purchase and wanted to send checks and schedule a mover to pick up. They promised that the movers would pick up after the check clears. They even offered straight up to pay for shipping/add more money to help secure the item. I knew this was too good to be true so I started doing some research on how these people could scam you using checks that could clear. Apparently, these people want you to believe that their check is real, so after you deposit it into your account thinking you've gotten the money, the money could get taken away if the bank later realizes there's something wrong with the check. However, you would have already shipped the item and paid for the movers.
So don't waste your time with people who will only pay via checks unless you can find a local branch and take cash out using the check. Needless to say, after i told these two scammers that I will only take a check from a bank with a local branch and have to get it cashed before we schedule the movers, they went crickets.

They just sent me an email telling me that my account has been removed cause I reveived many notifications telling me that i was violating the rules - which non of those is true !!!

I didnt received nothing before and , i just was selling stuff that people sell , diapers , furniture and thats it , Im
Not a crazy person trying to sell bad stuff , and I texted them and the response was :

We sent you a lot of notification that you re are violating the rules and you kept posting that kind of stuff , and we decided that we had to remove your account and you cant make another one cause is not allowed ???

excuse me , if Im doing good , or diapers are violation? i didnt know I checked the rules and theres nothing like that ,!!

Super mad cause ,
i tried with another email and , my posts are there but just for me , no views , no coments nothing !

That is ALL you get on this site. I am not sure who these people are that plan on buying anything, but they apparently expect everything to be $1! Even after I posted an awesome queen log bed with canope, sealy mattress and box Spring for $250, one person still asked what the lowest is I would go. This idiot has no idea how much real wood log beds cost. I then checked how many items actually get sold and it turns out it's pathetic! Not worth anyone's time!

This app absolutely SUCKS! Today for the third time a buyer has agreed to an buy an item from me, negotiated a price and set up a meeting place and time only to back out at the last minute with yet another lame excuse. These wishy washy buyers suffer no repercussions whatsoever for doing this and all three times I had other offers that I turned down because I thought the item was already sold. Something has to change or I will never use this app again.

My review you need to screen some of this you also need to put you must answer what you are selling

This site or app offers no way of posting items that you would like to sell unless you have an Android or IOS phone to install their app, and not everyone has one of those types of phones. I mean seriously why even build a website if you can't post items for sell on the website through your pc, it's just a big waste of time and I don't like having my time wasted. This is just my personal opinion but they could really improve there service if they offered a version for pc or even for windows phone, in conclusion if you must use this app use it at your own discretion as for me I'll just stick to Ebay or other sell and buy groups accordingly.

Honestly, you are totally wasting your time using this app/service. That's why there are so many negative reviews.....
NOBODY PAYS,
NOBODY TURNS UP
Save yourself the energy and effort, use EBAY or give your stuff to charity

I agree and disagree with reviews here.

First of all, OfferUp, the company, is giving people/communities a common online place to sell stuff as an alternative to websites like Craigslist. Like CL, it's free and it's user friendly. However, with OfferUp, you're able to maneuver through the posting process quicker, the app/page design itself is not as antiquated and is aesthetically more appealing and it's "one and done"- you conduct the transaction from start to finish via the app. This isn't to say one is necessarily better than the other, it's your choice.

Also, like Craigslist, it is not meant to compete with Ebay, Etsy, etc. With places like the aforementioned, you pay to list, you pay to process the transaction online, and they get their cut. Because of this, they can afford to have staff to help sort out problem sellers and buyers, guarantee products and refunds, and be the intervening party so you don't have to deal with that end of it.

So, as far as what OfferUp, the business, offers as ITS product, I give it 5 stars.

Most of the complaints on here are for things I don't believe OfferUp is responsible for. No-show buyers or sellers? Block them. Lowballers? Block them. They don't respond? Block them. You don't like one word responses? Block them. These types, and much worse, are everywhere, not just on OfferUp.

Use OfferUp for its intended purpose: an online yard sale, cleaning out your closets, whatever. If you have a business to run, OfferUp is not the place for it.

Avoid the scammers, flakes, and low ballers that use this app. as opposed to other similar apps ive had 0 good experiences with this one. Seems like it draws in the wrong kind of energy.

I have tried selling stuff on this app multiple times and keep dealing with "flakes" saying they want to buy my item then nothing.....or they say they are on there way and I give them my address and an hour later still no one. Or they message me after telling me what date and time they are coming only for them to give some lame excuse why they can't come. Just a bunch of flaky ass buyers on this app. Just gonna take my stuff to goodwill and donate it for a tax ride off. At least that way I get the amount I am wanting to sell it for rather then dealing with cheapskates and low balling buyers.

I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT LET GO AND THIS APP "OFFER"UP EITHER APP I HAVE HAD GOOD AND BAD EXPERIENCES. BUT AFTER LAST NIGHT I WILL NO LONGER BE USING OFFER UP. I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWS HERE, IT'S HARD TO TRUST ANYONE WHO SELLS SOMETHING BECAUSE YOU MAY END UP DEAD OR INJURED. BUT I GET THE PEOPLE QUICK TO SELL SOMETHING AND MEET UP ANYTIME BECAUSE IT SEEMS TOO ANXIOUS FOR ME AND IT'S NOT SAFE TO DO THAT. SO I HOPE THIS APP GETS SHUT DOWN SOON BEFORE SOMEONE GETS HURT.
