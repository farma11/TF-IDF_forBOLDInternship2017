Have been posting items of good value, and have sold an item also on Offer Up. But today, my account was removed. Seems they judge a book by it's cover instead of doing a little homework, to see if what you are selling is a real item or not. I posted about 8 things the last couple of days, one being a Christmas Tree In A Bag, that several places sell, like **** and ***** ****. Described what it was and even used a clear picture, but I guess instead of doing a little research, they decided it was not a Christmas Tree, but paraphernalia, and without any communication with me, just removed my account as items I had posted were collecting alerts! Guess that's what happens when kids run a site like this! So if you are reading this, my items are in ************ *** ***** ** ****. Find me on ** where you will see what you wanted to buy before I was removed.
