eBay has lost my business for good. I left years ago due to the problem with scammers and the fact that eBay protects the buyer and the sellers are always left holding the bill. I recently took 3 attempts to sell a PC on eBay, was scammed on the first two auctions and on the 3rd the buyer refused to pay. I was forced to go through their process of reporting the buyer for nonpayment and by their own policy, if after 4 days the buyer does not pay, the transaction should be closed an the buyer will get a "negative" remark on their status. I called on the 4th day after the time passed, explained that I sold the PC via another outlet and that I wanted the transaction cancelled and closed immediately. eBay rep agreed and asked me to manually close it to which I attempted 3 times to do so on the phone with the rep and was unsuccessful to which the rep told me that she would close the transaction and assured me no fees would be charged to me. Of course, she never closed the transaction and I got the money removed from my bank account unexpectedly and they are now telling me it will take 11 days to get my money back! meanwhile, they will earn interest on the money. eBay is a scam, nothing will be done as I checked the buyers rating and no negative statements were added and they won't even allow me to provide negative feedback on top of inappropriately taking my money! Stay away from eBay folks, especially if you want to sell. The screw the seller at every turn and protect the buyer at every opportunity.

I re-opened my Ebay account to purchase cleats for my son (no problems with that). Ten days later my Ebay account was hacked and they bought a $4199 camera - they tried to buy 2 cameras but my credit card didn't have $8400 available balance. I received 100s of spam emails that made me investigate what was going on and found the spam all started with an Ebay email and that's when I discovered the fraudulent charge. I called Ebay only 3 hours after the fraudulent purchase was made. I spoke with 3 different departments and had to explain the situation at great length each time. They didn't seem to understand the situation. The last person in the High Value Claims department assured me that he would resolve the issue within 24-48 hours and the cc charge would be reversed. I waited for the email from him confirming the resolution. 24 hours later after no such email, I called Ebay again and had to go through the same explanation to multiple people before I spoke to the High Value Claims dept. This person said the guy from the day before was mistaken and that they couldn't do anything to reverse the charge. He would investigate and have someone call me back. The original High Value guy from the 1st day called me back and acted like he was being nice and following up with me. He did finally say that he made a mistake and I would have to wait for the seller to refund my money. He said the camera already shipped and that they were doing some investigating into the "fraudulent" activity - this was 24 hours after I called! He went on to talk about how suspicious the hacking & charge was in that the shipping address wasn't changed and basically implied that I was making the whole thing up. If Ebay would have contacted the seller as soon as I alerted them then the camera wouldn't have shipped. Since they didn't do that and instead opened a request that told the seller that I hadn't received my item, the seller shipped it right away???? Now I have to wait for the item to be returned to the seller and sometime after that they will refund my $4199 to my credit card. Ebay did a horrible job of resolving and handling this matter. When I get my refund, I will close my Ebay account and stick with more trusted sites like Amazon!

I bought a 19.65 CT Fire Luster Sparkling 100% Natural MultiPattern AUSTRALIAN BoulderOpal at eBay. when it arrived it didn't look like the add at all. The shape of the stone was same as advertised but the stone had no color to it at all. I took a picture of it and protest to eBay. at first they said the seller will provide me with return label for free return. Then they said the shipper can not issue return label. The seller send me an address in Thailand to sen it back even though it was shipped from Frankfurt Germany. The shipping costs is seven times more that the item. I think eBay is responsible because the picture of the item in eBay web page was Photo shop enhanced with blue filter to make the colors bright and vivid. eBay must stop these people from selling items that are not true representation of the product.

eBay has violated my civil rights by denying me my first amendment right to leave negative feedback or complain about the eBay's policy of protecting sellers in the community forums. eBay was very aware that I returned the wrong item and the seller did not returned my money.

Whatever you do, do not sell on Ebay. They will ***** the seller every time and side with the buyer no matter what. Even though your ad may say "no refunds" and sold "as is" they don't care. If a buyer requests a return they will allow it, then freeze your Paypal money, then take the money out of your Paypal account without your permission. It's a total racket. The buyers know this and exploit it. Save yourself the grief and the 13% loss between Ebay and Paypal and sell local.

Sold a burberry belt on ebay after 10 days of delivery buyer opened a case claimes he received wrong item. Ended up buyer returned a used non brand belt back to me.I have sent pictures to ebay but they still insist they made the right decision of refunding the buyer.Ebay rule is Not fair to me and all other honest sellers.

Very poor service; I would not recommend selling any items on E Bay - I had nothing but problem and poor customer service. I had all documentation/proof and they still did not listen. I would rate them an F

if it weren't for the variety of merchandise that ebay has to offer i honestly would not shop there. they take more kindly to their merchants, than their customers. i have put in some disputes in the past for either not receiving my items, or items damaged upon receipt, and i always lost the disputes. so i was out of the money spent and the item ordered. the merchant always came out on top. ebays customer service reps are also unprofessional and lack any helpful information. also, they are not there to help you at all. i would not recommend ebay to friends and family.

Be aware about buy in Ebay, the product that you received are totally garbage, from China, and they don't do anything about it, is super difficult to communicate with them and the seller do what ever they want. Don't waste your money. be aware of ************ seller.

eBay has violated my civil rights by denying me my first amendment right to leave negative feedback or complain about the eBay's policy of protecting sellers in the community forums.

Ebay uses tricks against buyers to drive auction prices through the roof. For example I logged on to check what I was following and the end time said one day 14 minutes. I knew I would possibly be sleeping when it ended so I placed my bid. I woke up the next day and it still had one day 3 hours left. Ebay had made me think the auction was ending over twelve hours earlier so now I have to face 12 hours of new bids that will drive the price higher

Ebay is a SCAM!!! Ebay is robbing me of my money, they lied about returning my money, its been over 4 months, I kept calling their support which is based out of Philippines, they train their support to lie and give you the run around, I assuming so you get tired and give up.. I can't believe how horrible their service has become in the last few years.. I have other options but kept calling to get lied, and lied again!!! Ebay you STOLE my MONEY!!! YOU ARE BUNCH OF THIEVES!! No more Ebay for me, Amazon will get all my business..

Ebay shipping calculator is NOT accurate, resulting in up to 80% extra expense for the seller at the post office. Customer service representitives will sympathize for the error but will make no attempt to correct it. These errors, combined with Ebay's hefty seller fees will result in little to no money for the item you just sold. Both buyers and sellers should be able to trust that the final shipping amount is correct or be reimbursed by Ebay if able to prove otherwise. With so many other reputable online marketplaces available, it would be wise NOT to choose Ebay.

I've been an Ebay buyer for 10 years. I've sold 2 items recently and lost approximately $150 because of terrible policy, terrible customer service, and ridiculous fees. I sold brand new computer memory and stated no returns. Buyer did not ensure compatibility, requested a refund stating it was defective, and I could not decline this even though all indications point to incompatibility not defect. I called customer service to explicitly told me there was nothing I can do besides issue the refund then dispute it. After issuing the refund, receiving the RAM, testing it, and even continuing to use it (right now as we speak), I called customer service to dispute it and because I'm not a commercial account and, still, because the buyer SAID it was defective and because I initiated a refund (as I was instructed) that I cant do anything about it. Total Losses: Paid $159.99 for the item. Sold it for $82. Paid $7.99 to ship the item and another $2.75 to have it returned. $18.74 in Ebay Fees (thats 22.5% of the sale price) Now the product is opened and tampered with and it can't be sold as new. I've spent 3 hours on the phone with ebay or arguing with the buyer. Ebay now values this product at $40 opened for a grand total of= $149.47 ...and I just wanted to sell an item i wasnt going to use at a discount to get a few bucks. Now I'm OUT $150. I couldn't be more disgusted with their policies or their "too bad" attitude.

I could not be more disappointed with how eBay is handling a case of harassment with a buyer. I called 5 times to complain, wrote several emails, and had to get law enforcement involved. A buyer was stealing my personal photos of when I was young and using them in a threatening manner and eBay did nothing about it. I begged for them to block the user from harassing me further, but they did nothing. I escalated the issue 4 times and nothing. The buyer then destroyed my product and is demanding a refund and eBay SIDED with this man. A man that is harassing a woman with a family and using young photos of her on the eBay website to threaten her. How disgusting. I don't feel safe on their site any longer and they will not allow me to close my account, so I just have to accept this monster harassing me. I am traumatized and seeking treatment because of this. I was a faithful customer to eBay for 7-8 years and will now never ever use them again.

Horrific,disgusting,vile.I overpaid my ebay fees rather than refund my money they kept it for the following month.

I placed an order on www.eBay.com on 10/8/2017.Â  Within an hour ebay charged my credit card through show on my statement as Paypal.Â  Yet, I checked out of ebay with my credit card never authorizing them to use Paypal.Â  The seller of this purchase sent me a INVALID/SCAM/FAKE TRACKING NO. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.Â  On USPS it is still in PRE-Shipping status till today.Â  And no other carrier (UPS, FedEx)has this tracking no. as a valid one.Â  I keep get emails from the seller telling me my package is at my P.O. Box.Â  eBay.com REFUSES to DISPUTE this order and send it to the Resoultion Center in their company. They claim that Paypal is disputing it.Â  Yet, I did not authorize paypal to even cherge my account.Â  The seller information is as follows: address: XXXXX Blue ******* Rd., Evansville, IN XXXXX-XXXX, email is; **************** ***************@members.ebay.com

Look at the review rating 94% are negative, yet ebay has an A+ BBB rating, how is this possible? One cannot leave a negative review on ebay until 7 days have gone by, who does this protect, um, the vendors.

eBay customer service, all based in China or India does not help. There is an algorithm that both Appla and gmail are having problems with. I was told this by eBay technical support after I called because I could not send messages. After explaining my situation my account was then restricted but no one could tell me why. Dumb *** customer service.

They claim to have a "Money Back Guarantee" but thats a lot of **** I ordered two packages. Both accidentally went to the wrong address. Major user error on my end. But eBay doesn't care about that or their customers. I tried to get a refund for the package and got told no. I went to the neighbors place. They had one of the two that were delivered on the SAME DAY. So I file a claim. The seller couldn't do anything about it since the post office said it was delivered. So I make a half dozen calls and knock on some doors and no one has the package. I file a claim through eBay with zero luck. I kept getting told the same lame story over and over. So now I have to contact PayPal and see if they can do anything at all to help me out. Clearly eBay only cares about making money and not helping very very unhappy customers. They dont even bother to listen to what the real problem is. They dont care about customers at all. I should sue them for the whole 'Money Back Guarantee' scheme they're playing at. It was the worst experience to date. I will never ever shop with eBay again.

Unclear fees used. Charged me double fees without proper notification or reasoning. Explains that PayPal charges a separate fee but then did not offer a viable alternative for a one time seller to sell through. Basically you have to pay two fees or become a seller with a monthly fee. Never using again.

I placed an order for an external hard drive for a Macintosh computer before realizing that I already had access to the item in question, so I tried to cancel the order.... I was of course informed by the eBay represntative that they would need to contact the seller to resolve this cancellation despite the fact that I contacted them just 5 minutes after placing the order. Alright, so they need to confirm the cancel with the seler, thatis fine I thought. They did so, and I received an Email claiming that my refund had been approved. So, I check my Pay Pal account, and it shows the refund for the cost of the item, but the card account that the payment was originally taken from does not show anything about a refund at all. Also, there is no money that has been added to my Pay Pal balance either. I received this Email last night late, and did not see it until this morning whern I woke up and checked my Email, so it was outside of operating hours for both eBay, and Pay Pal to contact them. So, basically I will not be receiving the item, but they have decided to just keep my payment. This is unsatisfactory to me, and I am sickened by this now!!

Here is a letter that I sent to ebay recently concerning half.com closing and the loss of approximately $485 on my part. Mr. *****, My name is **** ***** and I am a retired firefighter who is trying to live the American dream of writing. I traded in many items to eBay's sister site, half.com, a while ago. I was excited to use my credit for reference material and books. Unfortunately, I was not aware that half.com was shutting down. I am in the process of moving and have not had a lot of down time recently. My problem is that my gift certificates for the items half.com accepted in trade in for me appear to be worthless now. I have consulted with both ebay and half.com customer service to see if I could be assisted. The gentleman I talked with was very nice and called me back two days later with the bad news that he could not help me. I have five gift certificates totaling about $483! I understand the failing on my part to not be aware of the closing, but I was hoping that some arrangement could be made to keep me from just losing out on this money. I would be eternally grateful if my half.com certificate credit could be switched to ebay gift credit. I have pics of the gift certificates to prove my story and would gladly send them if you would like. I realize how busy your schedule must be. I ask humbly if you could do this for me. Times are a little tight for me, and this credit would really help me out. Thank you for your time. ****

Add me to this list. Seller is playing a game of cat and mouse. Ebay is aware, and can see precisely what the seller is doing. (Working the system to delay refund). This is a financial nightmare for me. Recently I moved to the country, and a great distance from the nearest city. I purchased an RV friendly washing machine from a seller on ebay. It arrived rather promptly, but damaged beyond repair in shipping. I notified the seller, and he replied to me "I am sorry this arrived in such condition. Fedex will be there tomorrow to pick up the washer. You will need to do nothing, as they will have paperwork for you." Well, FIVE DAYS PASSED of me emailing the seller. Each day it was, "I am sorry they will be there tomorrow" Finally I called Fedex myself, and they said I needed a "recall number," thus I contacted the seller for this information. He now has forwarded the information, and unknown to me has changed the status from "exchange item" to "buyer wants a refund" I never authorized that. Originally the seller said a new one would be on it's way as soon as Fedex picked up the package, but now he says (and so does ebay) that there is nothing that can be done about a replacement and all I can do is wait an additional 8 days (5 business days) for a refund. NOW THE WORST PART...The damaged washing machine is on it's way back to me. The seller refused it saying that it was damaged in shipment to him. In addition, the seller says "I have not received the return yet" Um, I can read tracking info. Every bit of conversation has been done through the ebay relay system. The customer service reps can see what has happened, and agree with me that this is not ok. However, I still get "I am sorry there is nothing I can do" I have encountered rude and condescending reps during this entire ordeal. It is now three weeks since I made the purchase and three trips to town to do laundry at $50 per trip. In addition to the refund I have not yet received I am out $150 I could not afford. Total loss $250. My insurance is now going to lapse costing me an enormous amount of money for a renewal policy. If only I had made this purchase on Prime I would have had my replacement weeks ago.

I had purchased 2 gift cards for Ebay with $500.00 for a purchase a a car yet before sending the redemption codes to ebay I phoned ebay and asked about this car and they replied somebody is trying to scam you. 2 and a half months now I've been trying to get a refund for these ebay gift cards and have sent in photo's of everything they have requested 28 times.Mentally I'm exhausted and cannot go another day being mad at the world because of this.I'm now filing a complaint for I can't find any results dealing with this refund .

ebay has good prices and generally sellers are decent. but recently a seller ****** would not refund me for merchandise not received- i wrote to the president of ebay and he refused to issue a refund. A little crooked if you ask me.

EBay has taken a turn for the worse, i purchased an item and paid for it 30 days today. I submitted a support request on September 5th 2017. Ebay informed me that the seller had shipped the item and they extended the hold time to 9/10 then 9/15 then 9/17 and now to 9/21 I am done and it appears that their call center cant guarantee me a refund as they are asking me to wait to receive the item and then ship it back for a refund from the same seller who wont respond to messages. I have been an ebay customer since July 2001 and have made close to 400 transactions, I think this company has lost its edge which is why i will most likely not use their site again and advice you to do the same. Paypal for that matter has turned to **** also, i clicked to request a refund on the same item and it sends me back to ebay which is clear they cant do anything these days with a call center who knows where. I requested a supervisor and they told me they were all tied up on other calls.

I bought a painting on ebay, the seller sent it to me and was damaged in the mail. he had no insurance on the painting with fed ex. I retuned the painting to the seller and proof that he received the painting back. The seller said he never got the return painting so they will not refund my money. I am out over $1,000.00. There is a scam that some seller use is sell something for a lot of money and then say their didn't get it back so they have the painting and the money both and ebay wont do anything.

I have been a member of ebay almost since the incpetion of the online business. I had not sold in a very long time. Recently I attemped to sell 4 items. One was a large ticket item for $306. The item was damaged in shipping to the buyer hence a dispute was opened by the buyer. We communicated back and forth and the buyer inititated a claim with the USPS since I had insured the packaged. Ebay was supposedly monitoring the communication and mediating this dispute. I had decided to issue a refund for the item to the buyer and asked him to ship it back to me. A pop up on ebay indicated he woould have a certain amount of time to ship the item back before I would be credited for the sale. Unknown to me at the time the buyer had gived the packaged to the USPS since they requested it. Ebay closed the case shortly after the refund. The problem with this is that the buyer had the package, was fililng for the claim and had his money back. I asked ebay in 3 seperate emails to reopen this becuase the buyers still had the package after I had refunded the money. I essentially wanted to make sure I either got the package back of paid if the claim was piad by the USPS. All messages were ignored and not asnwered. To make the situation worse I received and invoice after this and they were charging me $30 in fees for selling the item which I obviously did not sell and had returned the money. I also found out that certain fees are charged for listing even when items do not sell. I had 3 other items that were charged multiple fees over and over that I never sell. I was unaware that even though you did not sell and item you could still be charged certain "special fees). I had some items in which I paid more in special fees than they were worth and I didnt even sell them. When I called ebay they did refund the charge for selling the item in which I had returned the money to the buyer. I had asked about all of the special fees on the items I didnt sell and the lady I spoke with told me she could give me a $20 credit towards the $37 worth of fees towards the items I didnt sell. I told her I had been around a long time and charging fees on items that didn't sell was new to me. She informed me this change was made approx. 1 year ago. I told her I was interested in the full refund. She indicated I will look into it and get back to you in 15 minutes and she confirmed my phone number before she hung up. It has been 3 days and I have not received a phone call. I will never sell anything on ebay again if I can help it.

I keep getting my identity stolen from Ebay. It happened a few years ago and the customer service was helpful, but today 09/14/2017 I tried to list a sells item with it stating I could not sell an item but gave no reason why. I had called and talked with customer service when I ask why I couldn't sell they had ask are you associated with these user names giving 2 user names. I replied no, I had never heard of either of those and told the rep my identity was stolen from Ebay before and ask if it was happening again. The only thing she told me was I was at risk and I wasn't allowed to sell. I ask her at risk for what her reply was " I can't discuss that with you." I ask if my identity was stolen again? She replied I can't discuss that with you. My paypal is linked to my Ebay and money was taken from my account before on top of the person who stole my identity selling over $10,000.00 worth of stuff (which would leave me with the taxes to pay on it. I contacted all of the proper people once I found out the name of the person and had it fixed the first time it happened. I only found out before because someone returned the item they bought from the other seller (thinking it was me) back to my home address. Ebay should inform me if someone stolen my identity so I know where to start instead of saying I can't discuss that with you. It is my bank account! My identity! My personal information I have the right to know so I can properly protect myself!!!

I've had a very negative experience with ebay. I'm a sometime seller. I was told THREE times by 3 different representatives that a claim would be found in my favor, that I had to wait until 9/9 to ask them to step in to do so, only to be told something completely different. I was called a liar because I was told there were no previous records on my case and that I didn't speak with anyone else previously, only to be told later, yes there were other notes on my case. They do not stand behind their word nor do they do anything to protect sellers who pay their fees. I will be taking my business elsewhere, they are not the only marketplace around. I would highly advise others to do so, as well. I'm also contact California's AG's office of consumer protection.

I have been a member of eBay since1999. I had no problems until last month. I send items to buyer. The buyer complained about Items. Before I shipped the items to buyer, I inspect there are any defective. But when buyer got Items, he complained about Items. I explained items are not manufacture defective, It's cracktastic of the items. Buyer claim to eBay money back guarantee. eBay's decision is buyer's favor. When complaint is end up by buyers favor, I have to pay full refund of money and buyer can keep the items. I feel there is something wrong. whenever reason buyer gets full refund, Items should send back to seller. Why buyer gets money and item? Any business, If you don't satisfy the item, you get money back, but item have to return to the store or seller. I feel I need sellers protection. Why buyer can keep items and money. I really don't understand the system. Now I'm asking lawer this system is against the law or not.

Massive Shill Bidding and Illegal Extortion Going on at eBay eBay has a big problem with certain sellers using aggressive shilling practices. I was a victim of this shilling on August 18th, 2017. Who did this shilling? Sellers ***************** and ********************* (I believe these two stores are run by the same seller or network. Here is what happened to me. I had put in some bids on a number of earrings by the 2 sellers above. I was out bid on most of them days before. I received a notice via eBay on August 18th that I was the high bidder for a pair of earrings I had previously been out bid on, and the auction was ending in 5 minutes. The auction ended and I, of course, had to pay for the item. I did a bit of investigation and saw that a previous bidder had retracted their bid, leaving me the high bidder. Well, I thought, okay, that's fine. Then, 5 minutes later, another notice from eBay popped up and said that I was high bidder for another pair of earrings that I was previously out bid on, and I won and to now pay for the item. Then another notice popped up with another pair of earrings that I was previously out bid on, that I now won and had to pay for. Then later in the evening, it happened again. This occurred a total of 4 times on this day. I did a bit of investigation, and it turned out that in all 4 of these auctions, a shill bidder retracted their bid minutes before the auctions ended, making me the high bidder, and making me pay for the items. Now, I find it highly odd and a coincidence that bids could be retracted for all 4 of those auctions. I don't believe in coincidences, but I do believe in deceitful people. Now, I have taken a look at the 2 stores above and can clearly see the shilling pattern used to illegally EXTORT money from people. In two of the auctions I was forced to pay for, it was the same bidder retracting their bid. The other two, are different, but shills none the less. If you go into the negative/neutral feedback of the 2 stores above, you will see others, like myself, who complained that the seller was using shills. Also, the seller is using automatic bids to shill. You should also be aware that the 2 stores above, are violating another eBay regulation: they are absolutely selling fake jewelry and passing them off as real 925 sterling silver gemstone jewelry. Nowhere in the description, for any of their jewelry, do they use the words: "overlay", "imitation", "simulant", "plating", "alloy", anything to truly describe the costume jewelry the are selling to the public. Here again, if you go in and read the negative/neutral feedback, you will find loads people that had acid tested the metal, had the gemstones tested, and the items were found to be complete fakes. I knew when I originally placed bids on the earrings, that they were, indeed, fakes - I was not bidding because they were real, I know the difference. Another thing. As I investigated, I came across other stores with the same kinds of complaints of bid manipulation/shilling and selling fake jewelry. There are more, I simply did not list them, you investigate: ********************** ********************* ************** ***************** ************************ ******************* ***************** *************** ***************** I believe there is massive shilling going on on eBay, a lot of it coming out of India, and I believe eBay to be turning a blind eye to this. You will see this if you check out the stores above and look for the others on eBay. So, now my question to you, eBay, is: What are you going to do about it? I am positive, I am not the first person to complain about the shilling going on in the list of stores above. You seem to cast a blind eye to this fraud and have allowed it to happen for quite some time, if the feedback from those 2 stores is any indication. Yes, I would like my money back for the items, since the money was gotten illegally through extortion means, as far as I am concerned. However, knowing eBay like I do, I doubt I will find restitution, since you do nothing about shilling. No, shilling is not hard to prove: I figured out the 2 stores above where shilling people within minutes, so I would assume eBay has intelligent detective types working for them and they, too, can see the pattern and figure it out. I want something done about this and those sellers before more unsuspecting people are victims of this sneaky type of extortion.

Two problems" 1. Customer disputed the item he purchased from me, claiming it was damaged, and requesting a refund. He had nearly one week to send the item back and never did. After more than two weeks, eBay finally credited my account back. The customer left a NEGATIVE feedback stating I wrapped the product in paper towel. TOTAL LIE. I called eBay and they said that unfortunately, there is nothing they can do about it. Customer are permitted to leave 100% lies in the feedback, and we are helpless. I wrapped this item in bubble wrap, but all people viewing my feedback will see that I wrapped it in paper towel. eBay is not telling me the truth on the phone about not being able to do anything about it. 2. With a 99% positive feedback, and a 97.9% sellers performance, I am banned from selling in bullion as a punishment for my low performance. This is unbelievably outrageous! I have since listed a large bullion collection on Amazon. eBay has lost $9,000 in eBay fees, and handed the profits to Amazon to punish me for nearly 100% positive feedback and sellers performance!!! Amazon fees are ridiculously high, but I am forced to use them because of eBay's ******* policies.

Ebay "tagged" my account, which had 100% positive reviews, because another account with a similar name and location owes them $90. They lowered my selling/buying amount pending this other person paying their debt. Their Privacy Policy was completely disregarded as they told me the person's name and the amount of money he owes. I asked how they can have another person's behavior affect my account and the manager said, "Because we can." I ended my account. Also, they had charged me $800 via paypal for listing a piece of furniture that never sold. I started a "complaint ticket" and they never responded and then ended the ticket.

As a seller and a buyer, I have had many problems with eBay and when I contact them they are less than helpful (and that's if you get someone who actually can speak fluent English without a very thick accent, i.e.; customer service is in the Philippines, were they can pay people less than half minimum wage and who only care about their paycheck at the end of the week). I have been buying and selling on eBay for over 13 years and I have seen eBay's policies change from giving sellers carte blanche to the pendulum swinging to having scam buyers take full advantage of Ebay's refund policy and allowing eBay buyers damage, steal and extort from sellers). In 2004, Donohoe took over and I watched many good sellers leave, because they were not respected, taken advantage off and felt they had no other choice but to leave for other venues. I have spent hundreds of hours talking with customer service representatives, who do nothing but spout back canned scripts like "I hear your frustration" or "I am sorry you have had a bad experience", only to end the phone call with I am sorry "it's just our policy or there is no remedy (except an policy change which they have no authority to change) for what ails "eBay". To see that eBay has an A+ on the *** when there are 197 customer reviews and 185 of those are NEGATIVE....should tell all readers of these reviews that the game is rigged (including the ***). I guess this what we get living in America, when no one is held accountable or has integrity (just look at how miserable a job Congress does and gets paid very handsomely for doing such a poor job). This has become the American business model......do nothing, fix nothing, spout rhetoric and get paid well. Again, how does the *** rate as an agency, when the agency (eBay) has 185 negative reviews out of 197 and over 6,000+ complaints about eBay. YET, the *** gives eBay an A+ review. People should get use to being exploited and ****** dry of their money, it's the American business way. I am tired of trying to work on ****, only to have them deaf, dumb, blind....but holding their hand out for money at the end of the month. The vampiric drain on me emotionally, financially and mentally for me is more than enough and the fact I cannot find anyone at eBay or any outside agency will to do anything to change the problems or to make eBay accountable for their bad business model/management is something I can no longer afford. Shame on eBay, shame of the *** and shame on our government for them letting corporations run without oversight and become the greedy ************ they are.

I purchased a 64GB usb thumb drive on eBay and it was found to be a fake counterfeit drive to look like the original. It was actually a 8GB drive with firmware installed for a 64GB drive so the pc will look at it as if it were a 64GB drive when plugged in. If I copied anything over 6.6Gb of data the remaining data will be corrupted and unusable. I contacted eBay twice to ban the seller which they still continue to let eBay buyers purchase this counterfeit item. I have contacted several of the buyers and mentioned to them how to test the drive which theirs were found to be counterfeit as well. All the seller does is give the money back and eBay doesn't do a thing. I have found other sellers selling the same items and contacted the buyers as well. They received counterfeit items also. The sellers have sold 100's and thousands of these items. I have reported them all and ebay does nothing. They need to stop all sells of USB drives as 90% of them are fake. To good to be true then don't buy it on eBay.
