As far as I know this website is legit. I have purchased MANY things on this website including phones, fans, ipods, video games furniture and even a WII U. There was one incident when they sent me a game for the wrong console. I told about my problem and they let me keep and they also sent me the right one after. This website is good. The only thing i have to say is to make sure you read the description before buying something.
