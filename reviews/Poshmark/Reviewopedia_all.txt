Company would not provide refund when seller posted the wrong size in the size field. Sellers should never be allowed to advertise wrong sizes--even if--especially if they think the sho runs big or small.

This is misleading to customers. Their decision not to hold sellers accountable, but rather to pass this issue off on to the customer demonstrates a poor business model. I contacted company to request a refund, and they refused to refund my money, claiming that the seller explained why they changed the size in the size field.
This was not the first time.I had bought several others shoes that were advertised incorrectly.
