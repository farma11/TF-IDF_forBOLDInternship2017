My recommendation is to buy and sell elsewhere. The multitude of negative comments exist for a reason and should not be ignored. In addition to the large percentage that is taken when you sell, they actually fail to support. Their system will indicate that packages have been delivered, even if you have not received them. I have tried to make Poshmark aware of this; you can't inspect a package if it hasn't been received! Buyers must accept a package three days after it's received but sellers have SEVEN days to ship. The concept business must be reworked. Many sellers are also selling fraudulent items and Poshmark will not ban them once this has been revealed. This means that they can continue to sell to others who are not made aware. When in fault, they offer minimal Poshmark credit.

I am a little torn with this site. In the beginning, I felt this was such a great idea and felt I was having success selling lightly used clothes/accessories that I no longer wanted. Now, I'm no full time seller. I have only made about $100 total and sold 8 or 9 items, but here is my experience so far. ******I have had one return on a pair of boots and I take full responsibility for the mistake I had made. Not sure how it happened, but I had given wrong sizing on the post and never noticed. The boots where sent back just as they where sent to them and all was good. Overall, not an unreasonable experience.******** #####-I have recently experienced an issue with a buyer that I find to be a bit frustrating. I sold a XL Hurley jacket to a women who only paid $13 (making my actual earnings $10 and her total payment around $20 with shipping) She received the item and gave a review of 1. She CLAIMS that there is no way the jacket is a size XL and that it must be sized in Juniors sizing. In the review, she mentions that it doesn't even zip (1-its a button up jacket) and there is no way it will close. Claimed she had plenty of Hurley jackets in a size medium, they all fit perfectly. At this point I have come to the conclusion that she is a bigger size woman. I wear a size small/medium in WOMENS and the jacket was drowning me before I sold it. I thought that if she felt strongly enough she could file a claim and Poshmark would be our buffer. It was not in junior sizing so there was no reason for me to apologize and reach out to her. She never filed a claim. It came to the point were payment had been processed and was deposited into my bank account. I'm assuming she noticed as well when that happened because she decided to copy and paste the review under the sold jackets posting the same day. ######## Here is my theory with this, I believe that she may not fit the jacket like she wanted too. It may not be the right color or the right material. She asked no questions before purchasing. The jacket was perfect and just as described. SHE HAD NO CASE. So if she were to file, I believe, that she felt she would not win and had to amount to other terms. By reaching out to me I think she expects a seller approved return because of her dissatisfaction. Now, if she does REALLY believe that this is sized in juniors, she still has no proof for her case so that may be why she hasn't filed either. I have not shopped junior sizing since I was 15. I do not have proof of that either since I purchased this jacket too big and that was over a year ago. So looks like we are both out of luck. ##### I really do not want to rip people off and I am more than willing to correct my mistakes, but if you purchase something at your own discretion from a USED clothing site, do your research. BUYERS: Need to be active in there purchases. Be aware of what you're risking buying USED items. Not everyone in this world is honest and thorough. Ask a lot of questions before purchasing. Confirm things in the comments and screen shot so that if something is not as it seems, you have a case. ASK ASK ASK. Im sorry, but its not just a sellers responsibility to make sure you are satisfied with what you're purchasing. Take some action and get all of the info. SELLERS: decide if its worth it. Poshmark takes effort and time to really get those sales. Accuracy and honesty is the most guarantee you can have on this site and even then its not always enough to satisfy a customer. I suggest taking pictures of the items BEFORE sending and using them for a case if the item is returned and damaged. (This has yet to happen to me, but found it to be common in the reviews) Make sure to time stamp it. Be as thorough in descriptions as possible and remember it is not your responsibility to clarify if the customer has not asked the questions. Site reference is always your BEST bet. If you can reference an item from the brand and site it came from, that is all the proof you need. Grow up people and take responsibility. Be honest as a seller and be skeptical as a buyer. I have made money on clothes that I would have otherwise thrown out after collecting dust in my closet. I appreciate that about Poshmark, but there are some flaws and Poshmark should be more active in there buyer/seller relationships when things go crazy. There needs to be proof of seller before sending items so that sellers can be protected from buyers who destroy things because of there remorse. Sellers should be able to ask as many questions as needed and expect honest answers. Higher priced items should NEED proof of purchase so that no one is a victim to price mark ups or fakes. So many things should be improved and the best they got is an "automatic price drop tap".

As a customer: I have yet to purchase something, but have had my own experiences with buyers and have a little advice. Really ask the questions. This is a majority USED clothing site and these things are not discounted because they are brand new. I have loved when buyers ask questions because that saves me from a return and them from disappointment. I as a buyer have had lacking descriptions on my items and questions work to clear that up. This is no different than buying from a community page through facebook or a yard sale site. Only thing that really benefits you here is your safety and guidelines given to you. There is rules and from what I understand they work to really keep the buyers happy. Now as a buyer, if you are loyal, thorough, and honest you will also find the same in the sellers you purchase from. If you lie, cheat, or disobey the system than I guarantee you will be reported, harassed, and possibly suspended from the site. I do not support harassment, but I have seen it happen to others. This is a community of sellers and some don't take fraud lightly. As a seller: I have yet to have any issues with scamming. I did have someone recently purchase and item on the higher $$$ side and I was worried because the user had previously signed up that morning and purchased my item an hour later with no offers or questions. I was skeptical but everything went perfectly. Just remember that your items are not only on Poshmark, but can be viewed through google. I have had a return and it was by my mistake of mislabeling the listing. No issues there and we where both left happy. I did have an experience with a customer who felt I had lied about the size of an item. She felt it was sized in juniors sizing and left a low 1 review despite the quality of the jacket and being as described. I knew that this was not junior sizing and although I was sympathetic, I did not owe her for her opinion. She later left a review on the direct post and I continued to ignore the comments. She was very harsh and was not constructive. She could have filed a return, but I think we both knew that the jacket was labeled as described and if she had done her research she would have found out that the jacket is not in junior sizing. I later found that she was trying to sell the same jacket for twice what she paid and had it labeled as XL. not junior xl. So I believe she came to the correct conclusion. This site is a risk. Its a also a game. You have to put in the work and be willing to work with others to get items sold. I do not do this as a business. Its just a way to make a few dollars off of lightly used items I no longer want. I have yet to experience a scam, but the second I do I will remove my closet from the site. I have seen enough reviews and horror stories to know that this site is not perfect. Beware. I wouldn't sell high priced items, I wouldn't sell outside of the site to a customer, and I also wouldn't purchase there boutique clothing. It is way overpriced for how not worth it majority of it is.

Absolutely horrible experience. Twice I was scammed. The first time I sold a black Lularoe shirt. The buyer disputed it and said it was not in described condition. The buyer then was to return the shirt to me after Poshmark sided with their complaint. When I received it back, the black Lularoe shirt I sold was NOT in the box. The buyer stole my shirt and returned it with a cheap black tshirt. The second time I got scammed I sold a Stella and Dot necklace worth $95.It was brand new in the original packaging and the buyer said it was not as described/broken. When the buyer disputed it I submitted the exact pictures I used to describe it but Poshmark again sided with the buyer. I will never do business on this site again and I highly discourage anyone else from using it.

I began shopping on Poshmark, and found 2 good sellers, I ordered their items and the items came on time and in the condition described. That was the only good part. Then there are the bad sellers, which the website seems to support; who, after you place an order and have waited a week, with the funds already withdrawn from your account, cancel the order because, get this, "they have changed their mind!" and better yet, they tell a lie that the "product is damaged". Who on God's green earth would ever do business with people like this? Who put an item up for sale, take your money, and then after making you wait a week, change their mind, and cancel the order? Then your money is gone for 3 weeks! The week you waited for your order, and the two weeks you have to wait until the funds are back in your account before you can purchase something else! This site sucks. Stay away from it they gossip and slander people and creepily "follow people" through their website, thus invading your privacy, and turning sellers away from prospective buyers through gossip or slander. They call this 'following' on thier webiste and actually allow this!!! On your account it is shown that ..."so and so is following you," as they describe it, and you don't know who is 'following you'!!! then, if they have an agenda or grudge against you, they can get the seller to "cancel your order, because the seller mysteriously 'changed their mind,' or the item was somehow 'mysteriously damaged' !!! The weirdest thing ever!!! Spooky and weird!!! This is not done on reputable sites such as ****** or **** or **********, or many others. Poshmark is simply not behaving reputably! I had to ask help from a bank representative about my funds being restored to my account after the seller had" mysteriously canceled" my order, and I told the Bank Representative what happened, and she said she also shops on Poshmark! and she said, quote "THAT IS NO WAY TO DO BUSINESS. I WOULD CANCEL MY ACCOUNT WITH THEM." then it is almost impossible to cancel your account, for they make you petition Poshmark to cancel your account and then they do not cancel it upon your request!!! So be forewarned, and save your money and time, save your poor self the huge disappointment, of Poshmark's mysterious "wild goose chase" after "spuriously sold" and "canceled items", and go elsewhere where the customers are respected and the sellers are honest.

I order a purse from Poshmark for $40. I was sent a message a couple of days later telling me the purse was sold out BUT they have the same purse in a different color for $60 dollars. I ordered the purse and received it. I was very happy with my purchase. The following day I received my original order. Now I have two purses. I contacted the company and they basically told me to take a hike so I contacted my credit card company and filed a complaint. I informed Poshmark I had filed a complaint and ***** told me they would make a one time acception and accept the retuned item for a full refund IF I stopped the complaint. I told ***** if I did not receive a full refund of $60 plus shipping $4.69, I would reopen my complaint. The did make a refund but they refunded $46.69. I returned the $60 purse. This company is a scam. They did a switch and bait and need to be called out. Stay away

After registering an account, placing the order, paying with Paypal, etc. the item never showed up. No response from seller or from the company. Frustrating!! Their recommendation is just to cancel the order. I wouldn't have ordered the item if I wanted to just cancel it.

I was completely scammed. I ordered a Free People dress, with pictures of the dress directly from Free People site. I received, and it was NOT Free People, but rather this person's knock off - which was made of very cheap fabric and extremely poor fit. I contacted them about it, and received an auto-response promising a response within 24 hours, but instead have been completely ignored.

I have sold numerous things on this site and people take advantage of niceness and accommodation. Buyers buy things and once they don't like it or change their mind file a case review and Poshmark will side with the buyer 100% of the time in less than a day!!! The website has no loyalty to the sellers even though without the sellers Poshmark wouldn't exist! Buyers will give low ball offers even though a lot of of the items are super low. EX. $ 5 for a Nasty Girl leather top already marked at $15 and NEVER WORN! I am the last one to write a review but I had glasses shipped out perfectly and the girl said they were damaged and lenses were popped out even though wrapped in tissue paper inside a bag, but because of "proof" with pictures it was accepted to return. This company in the bay area is a joke and not respected clearly by the bay nor users. Bottom line: if you are a seller-get ready to be at the mercy of the buyers and even though they know what they are buying they will get you in trouble and want a return which will be gladly accepted. Buyers will put anything down or do anything to your product for a refund and poshmark is just as disloyal and guilty. Some buyers are great and others are the scum of the earth. You learn a lot of how shady people and business work. If you sell, get ready for people to buy things and claim it's not at all what they thought and go to the extent of damaging your items and Poshmark giving you nothing in return except a bad taste.

This seems like a fun and nice way to buy and sell items but it is a total SCAM. As the sellers you are not protected. I recently sold a wallet to a woman, the wallet was in perfect condition, i even sent the box and dustbag and she opened a case against me claiming it was not as described. I emailed poshmark asking to see the pictures because I was so confused as to why a case would be opened up and once they SIDED with her and refunded her the pictures became available to me and low and be hold she RIPPED the wallet herself. An expensive 400 dollar versace wallet and she basically tore it up claimig I sent it to her that way. Now my wallet is being sent back to me destroyed and is basically unsellable or unusable and poshmark has not answered me. They are un responsive and do not know how to run a business. Basically if someone buys something of yours and decides they dont like it, they can destroy it and claim it came that way and basically you are out of your money and your item can return to u damaged. I was shocked that someone would even do that to something so expensive or to someone in general and poshmark just doesn't care. This whole website is awful and NEEDS to be shut down. DO NOT sell your stuff on this scam of a website because they will take your money and ruin your stuff. There are countless negative complaints about it im surprised this website is still running. I have never seen a business be run so awfully and so careless. DO NOT USE. safe yourself the trouble and sell elsewhere. I will be shutting my account down and selling somewhere else. Somewhere trustworthy.

ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I THOUGHT i was buying a gray "Love Your Melon" hat and what I got was a dark blue and a hat that seriously would fit a giants head. This hat was MASSIVE. My head would have to MASSIVE in order for the hat to fit me. I wrote to them multiple times and they said the same thing. "You should've asked the seller if the item was true to size and color." ARE YOU KIDDING ME? The seller should list the item appropriately. I'm LIVID. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE.

BEWARE OF THIS COMPANY! I purchased a jacket that was incorrectly measured by seller. I could not return it and no refund. Customer service is only in Poshmark’s favor. Apparently Poshmark or seller have no responsibility for making this right . If transaction goes well, fine, if there is a problem, you are out of luck.

There are no returns, refunds, or exchanges, but they don't make that clear on the website. I purchased a coat for my daughter and since she couldn't try it on beforehand and it was too small we are stuck with it without recourse. Never will I use them again!

shoes that were shipped were badly used..the soles were dirty and the maker logo on the insole was worn out...the listing did not mention that the shoes were used....I wrote poshmark and they want me to send pictures of the shoes...I don't have acamera ...I am pissed off that they do not believe me that I am dissatisfied....cant understand how they are able to stay in business this long ..i am giving them a zero rating

I bought a sweatshirt from Poshmark for the first time and there were holes and stains everywhere! I went to file a complaint and they only allowed 72 hours to do so. The sweatshirt didn't even arrive until after a week! I'll NEVER order off this website again. Period.

To echo what many others have said on here, Poshmark has serious problems with its customer service on the seller end. They have ignored for over 2 weeks multiple attempts asking them to remove libelous comments from sales listings. In their email receipt acknowledgement, they promise a response within 24 hours during the work week but have completely disregarded me.

BUYER BEWARE! I just started shopping on Poshmark because I found a couple of items that were cheaper than ebay ... my mistake. Within the last 2 days, I've had 2 orders cancelled by 2 different sellers because they changed their minds (in case it helps other potential buyers, the specific sellers are ****** @ ********** ** **** ****** ***** ** and ***** * *********). Yes, I got refunds in both cases, but I actually WANTED both items - that's why I purchased them. Poshmark has no way of rating sellers if they flippantly cancel your orders, and the sellers can DELETE comments they don't like. In other words, you have ZERO protection as a buyer. Heaven forbid you spend money and never receive your item or receive it in poor condition. I see no way to file a complaint on the Poshmark site. **** may be overly protective of buyers, often to the detriment of sellers, but it's a much safer shopping experience.

Do not use ************. I purchased a pair of converse and never got any shipping info or status for more than 2 weeks. There's no way to check my order status. This site is a scam. Anyone giving this site more than 1 star is part of the scam.

I purchased A I phone from seller " ********* " No product and the Poshmark allows him to block my messages so he can scam other customers. Furthermore each time I see this scammer trying to sell the same product to others Poshmark protects the seller by not allowing me to warn them . Poshmark will not allow me to warn the public about Seller ********* I believe because they receive 20% of sales . Any questions ****************

Customer service was awful received a dress with broken zipper...i paid $150. I don't feel like I should of paid full price and they came back and Offered $20 is poshmark dollars. I said no- I want to be refunded with the original method of payment. Since then NO response and have wrote them back about 5x. Don't use site! Awful!

I bought and sold clothes on poshmark for a while with no issue, until someone purchased a pair of pants from me, claimed they were damaged, and received a refund. I know they had no hole when I shipped them and that the buyer tore the pants. I understand that Poshmark is bound to grant the refund because it's a she said/she said situation and I think by their estimation, it's best to avoid someone disputing a credit card charge. What bothers me is how difficult it was to get customer service support. Poshmark takes a healthy chunk out of every sale and for that I should be able to get someone to send me something other than a canned email response. I endured several rounds of me sending an email with a description of the issue, them responding by asking for more information, me sending it and then never hearing back. They need to set up phone support and better equip their existing customer service representatives. I shouldn't have to tweet at them to get a response.

Overall I have had a pleasant buying/selling experience on Poshmark. As with any buying/selling app, look out for misrepresented items, etc.--not everyone online operates with the same level of integrity. Check seller feedback scores for an idea of their trustworthiness. Posh support has generally been helpful in the relatively rare event of an issue arising, and the user always has recourse to Paypal protection--provided you pay with PP. Posh's cut is 20%, more than some other apps, so I'll dock a star for that. The standard shipping rate of $6.50 works in your favor for heavier items, and against you for cheap/lightweight ones, so I'll call that a wash. Boutique items can often be gotten cheaper elsewhere online... savvy shoppers will know this. But as for gently used items, a favorite place to shop and sell.

Just not a great way to buy stuff. I bought something that was misrepresented and my request to return it was denied. Won't be buying again.

I just made my first sale on poshmark and found out that they don't actually PAY me the money I made. It's all "credits" to buy more from their site. NO WHERE does their site say this when you explore selling with them. I have pored over their FAQs, selling pages, etc. NOTHING tells me I will not actually make the money from my sale. FRICKIN scam. I will not use my credits to buy with them because that too has been a disaster. I received something not as described and they declined my return. On every level this site is a scam.

Do not download this app to your smartphone. They are not like **** or ****** they are a bunch of unprofessional Crooks. Do not use this app read the reviews.

Absolutely non-ethical company. Bought a dress, got dress, dress was labeled as a certain size but had clearly been shrunk. Zipper was warped, and wouldn't zip. Dress will never fit. Complained, and after a series of back and forth, they denied my return request because technically, the dress was the same size that was advertised. I explained that no, technically it wasn't. They would not even address the broken zipper, even after asking them point blank "why are you not addressing the broken zipper." In response, they actually told me in an email (so i have it in writing) that I can go ahead and try reselling the item. Enraged, I asked them if that is their typical policy, to knowingly encourage users to sell bad items so that they can continue to profit off of already high percentages of the sale. No response. I cannot even believe that a business can so transparently be this non-ethical. DO NOT USE Poshmark. There are far better clothes selling/trading sites.

I have been selling on Poshmark since March of this year. and until recently, I had zero problems with any customers or Posh. It all started to come apart with the sale of 5 pieces of clip on hair extensions. this chick hinted at me for weeks that she really wanted the hair, but couldn't afford them. (they were 40 bucks). So I lowered them for this woman, she paid, I shipped. a week later I received an email from Posh stating that I had a "case" against me on this hair!...the woman stated she has super thin hair, and that (5 little pieces) wouldn't make her hair thicker...(umm 5 pieces). they said they were giving her back her money!...no one asked me if I wanted to defend myself and the product, just "we're giving her the money back"...WHAT?...I sent an email directly back stating I hadn't misrepresented this product ever, along with all photos....I got nothing from them. Then I wake up this morning to Posh saying another "case" has opened against me for selling fake Victoria's Secret body spray!!...I even included the original skew number on the bottle, and the original $16.00 price tag!...and I even sent her the $16 body lotion as a bundle all for only $10!... so I sent the following email to Posh today..... to Poshmark To Whom this may concern, I have been receiving emails from your company that accuse me of selling "fake" wares. You have sided with 2 buyers, without ever "asking" me to provide any proof so I can defend myself. As a result, I am emailing you to ask your company to review all information "I" have on the 22" clip on 5 pc hair set, the "Victoria's Secret" Love Spell body spray and lotion set, and any makeup palettes I have for sale. I want you to ask the perfume customer to send you a photo I purposely left on the bottom of the bottle that has both the VS skew number and the $16 price tag. yea, price tag. Also, at not time did I ever misinform ANYONE about the 22" hair!, I was asked a question from another posher about my 30" long hair...it weighed 80 to 90 grams. Not the 5 piece hair. Further, it's not my fault the the person who bought it is folically challenged, it's 5 pieces of clip on strands of hair, not a bundle of weave in hair. I am including pictures of these products I had for sale so you can see what I'm saying is the Gods honest truth. also, I do expect to get your photos, and everything you have on file that proves me wrong. seems fair to me. Now, as to the eye shadow palettes, lipsticks, etc. REAL!...ALL OF THEM. but I will help you out weeding out all your other poshers with fakes, oh, but then you must have already done that, right? I am considering this lack of evidence on your part regarding my "dishonesty" to be harassment. and without your evidence, I will consider any missing funds in my accounts nothing short of theft, and will proceed with my Attorney. Thank you. **** I am closing my store this weekend, and selling somewhere else. I also contacted an Attorney who tells me they cannot hold any money I have coming to me,($220) nor can they take funds from my accounts. NEVER SELL ON POSHMARK!...HORRID SELLER PROTECTION, NO COMMUNICATION, AND SLOW PAYMENTS! ****

Any government agencies, please take an action with this company. They are Criminals allowing criminals to sell Fake items and allowing criminals to sell items that took pictures of others. Despite of complaints, emails, evidences, messages of criminal intent, Poshmark never do anything to stop them, Poshmark do not care as long as they got their money. Please investigate and close this business, every messages from them are computerized. Bad business like this is not healthy to the community. Please stop them.

I sold a necklace 12 days ago , se buyer claimed it was not as described , this necklace was brand new and exactly as described , I submitted all the proofs and pictures of the item to poshmark support , never heard about them again and now i'm out of my item and my money , so basically it's a steal. I'm not talking about the scamming attempts you get every time you post a new item ....and the nasty comments....

I bought several things from Poshmark over the course of a few months however stopped once I found out that their "poshmark guarantee" saying they will stand behind a purchase is a lie - I contacted them immediately upon receiving an item I had purchased that was inconsistent with how it was described in the ad. The item was described as "like new" when it was in fact very worn, had strings coming out of it and was unwearable.Poshmark said there was nothing wrong with the description and would not offer a return or refund. Do not believe this company's lies about providing a guarantee for your purchases - when it comes time to take them up on this assurance you will find out that the guarantee was a lie and they will not honor it.

It shouldn't surprise me that I'm writing a post about the continuation of racism in 2017. However, here I am. POSHMARK is the MOST RACIST site I have ever tried to buy and sell on. Their lack of professionalism, inequality and disparity between what certain ethnicities are allowed to do on the site is insane. Poshmark is NOT the site for you if you are a minority looking to make extra money. White individuals are allowed to harass you, run scams and sell whatever they like on the site (real or fake) despite rules stating that this is against the policy. I guess "white" is "right" huh? Numerous white individuals have harassed me about products they are NOT going to purchase, I have been continuously reported for things I have NOT done wrong and a white individual was able to file a claim against an item I sent, and receive her money back. While, I am still without my item. Living in a world where racism and white privilege is prevalent in everyday life. I would have thought there would be a slight relief from poshmark administration, WRONG..I refuse to be treated unfairly by poshmark. I no longer will be using this site for any services, as they are not worthy of having my "Black Dollars"

I've used Poshmark for many years and really enjoyed my experience at first because sometimes you really do get great deals on items that are old season and not sold in stores anymore and are new things to add to your closet. However my issues started when I became a seller instead of a buyer. That's when problems and issues started occurring. The first incident involved when I was selling a pair of boots. I did mention it had been previously worn, but was still wearable for future uses and had photographic evidence before it was shipped out of it and evidence of several people who did help me ship out the boots that they don't recall something ever being wrong with it. However the customer ended up returning on grounds that "it was not as described" and sent in evidence that there were stains and the heel was broken. I sent in photograph proof that there was no way the heel was broken before and I had two people who remembered seeing it in fine shape. There was another incident where I was selling a backpack and described it as having been worn many times which pictures included. Someone bought it but ended up arguing on claims of stains which they zoomed in on this tiny barely noticeable stain that only would be seen if you were really really looking for something. However in both instances Poshmark sided with the customers. So be wary that sometimes customers can purposely damage your goods to hopefully get their money back and file it under as "damaged item" or purposely try to find any small reason to get their money back. It's just so irritating for sellers because it takes time out of our schedules to ship things out and prepare the packages just to have it sent back. It was a really aggravating experience to say the least because the only way to contact customer service is through email and it took absolutely forever to ever get a response back. I had to email about three times before someone finally replied and she barely answered my questions and concerns. I find that happening frequently when you email them for any customer support. Maybe they should work on a better system on that? I don't know. Next incidents involve sometimes having buyers really talk down on you rudely. There was an incident where I had a buyer purchase a mystery box of random things for only ten dollars that would include variety of things that I was looking to size down my wardrobe and belongings including items from top brands. I included a note in there that was handwritten with a list of all the things she would be getting. I handpicked all of these items that I spent in total well over 10 dollars. 6 items that probably costed more than 50 dollars original price. I wrapped it very nicely and yet she claimed she never received one of the items and was quite rude about it.Then following incidents involved when I was on vacation (out of the country) and several people ended up purchasing items. I barely had wifi connection and yet I still told them I was out of town but will ship immediately when I got back. They all said it alright and yet in the end a good portion of them ended up being impatient and canceling the order resulting in strikes against my account. It's absolutely aggravating and my account was suspended due to "unshipped items" It seems even when you're in contact with buyers, you really do get duped as shippers. Furthermore poshmark really does a HUGE percentage off of your earnings that it's really not even worth it sometimes. And for buyers the disadvantage is the ridiculous cost of shipping. I remembered when it was around 4 dollars maybe and it seems like they slowly keep increasing the shipping costs. Overall, I really do think you're better off being a buyer on this app (if you can handle the outrageous shipping). Anyone who wants to be a seller on this app should be wary of the buyers, poshmark being very biased towards buyers instead of sellers, poor customer service, and the large percentage they take off of your earnings. There really are better buy/sell apps out there....

Poshmark lets total scammers be sellers. Poshmark does not communicate. They don't care if you get ripped off
